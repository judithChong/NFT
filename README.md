After finishing the tutorial I was able to create this simple nft project where people can come and mint their nft and also get the opportunity to get whitelisted.

This smart contract implements the following functionalities:

1. Owner can whitelist and remove whitelisted users;
2. Owner can set a minting cost for non-whitelisted users
3. Owner can pause minting
4. Owner can withdraw the minting fees collected
5. Owner can change the max minting amount allowed
6. Owner can change the base uri and the base  extension
7. Users can mint for free if they are whitelisted else they have to pay to mint
